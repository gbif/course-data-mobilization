In general we are talking about georeferenced data – i.e. records with geographic references that tie them to a particular place in space – whether with a georeferenced coordinate (e.g. latitude and longitude, UTM) or not (textual description of a locality, altitude, depth) – and time (date, time of day)."

They have nothing to do with their relationship to the true value, and may have high precision, but low accuracy.  Numerical precision is the number of significant digits that an observation is recorded in and has become far more obvious with the advent of computers.  For example a database may output a decimal latitude/longitude record to 10 decimal places – i.e. ca .01 mm when in reality the record has a resolution no greater than 10-100 m (3-4 decimal places).  This often leads to a false impression of both the resolution and the accuracy."

"其次，數值精度指的是記錄有效位數的個數，並隨著電腦的出現更加明顯。舉例而言，資料庫中可以輸出經度/緯度至小數點下10位的準確度(約為現實中之0.1mm)，然而該記錄的解析度實際上並不優於10-100m(小數點下3-4位)，這常導致大眾對解析度與準確度產生了混淆、錯誤的認識。"

As independently stated by Chrisman (1991) and Strong et al. (1997), data quality is related to use and cannot be assessed independently of the user.  In a database, the data have no actual quality or value (Dalcin 2004); they only have potential value that is realized only when someone uses the data to do something useful.  Information quality relates to its ability to satisfy its customers and to meet customers’ needs (English 1999)."

Taulbee (1996) makes the distinction between Quality Control and Quality Assurance and stresses that one cannot exist without the other if quality goals are to be met.  She defines Quality Control as a judgement of quality based on internal standards, processes and procedures established to control and monitor quality; and Quality Assurance as a judgement of quality based on standards external to the process and is the reviewing of the activities and quality control processes to insure that the final products meet predetermined standards of quality."

Uncertainty is a property of the observer’s understanding of the data, and is more about the observer than the data per se.  There is always uncertainty in data; the difficulty is in recording, understanding and visualizing that uncertainty so that others can also understand it.  Uncertainty is a key term in understanding risk and risk assessment."

Random error tends to refer to deviation from the true state in a random manner.  Systematic error or bias arises from a uniform shift in values and is sometimes described as having ‘relative accuracy’ in the cartographic world (Chrisman 1991).  In determining ‘fitness for use’ systematic error may be acceptable for some applications, and unfit for others."
msgstr "「誤差」(Error )一詞同時包含了資料的不精準(imprecision)與不正確(inaccuracy)兩個層面。有許多因素會造成誤差，但一般來說，誤差會被視為是隨機、或系統性的──隨機誤差指的是隨機抽樣造成測量值與真實值之間產生的偏差；而系統性誤差則來自值上的整體偏移，若從製圖學的視角看仍保有「相對的正確性」(Chrisman 1991)，是而在決定「適用性」時，在某些應用上系統誤差在可能是可被接受的。\n\n"

msgid "Validation is a process used to determine if data are inaccurate, incomplete, or unreasonable.  The process may include format checks, completeness checks, reasonableness checks, limit checks, review of the data to identify outliers (geographic, statistical, temporal or environmental) or other errors, and assessment of data by subject area experts (e.g. taxonomic specialists).  These processes usually result in flagging, documenting and subsequent checking of suspect records.  Validation checks may also involve checking for compliance against applicable standards, rules, and conventions.  A key stage in data validation and cleaning is to identify the root causes of the errors detected and to focus on preventing those errors from re-occurring (Redman 2001)."
msgstr "資料驗證(Validation)是檢查資料是否正確、完整、合理的過程。其中包含：格式檢查、完整度檢查、合理性檢查、限制檢查，資料回顧(藉此判別離群值及其他誤差。如：地理上、統計上、時間上、環境性的......等等)，以及相關領域專家(如：分類學家)對資料的評估。此外，這階段也會去檢查資料是否遵守適用的標準、規則和慣例。這些檢查常會將可疑紀錄標記、整理出來，並進行後續的確認。找出造成誤差的主因，並盡可能避免這些錯誤再度發生，是驗證與清理中的關鍵階段(Redman 2001)。"

msgid "Data cleaning refers to the process of “fixing” errors in the data that have been identified during the validation process.  The term is synonymous with “data cleansing”, although some use data cleansing to encompass both data validation and data cleaning.  It is important in the data cleaning process that data is not inadvertently lost, and changes to existing information be carried out very carefully.  It is often better to retain both the old (original data) and the new (corrected data) side by side in the database so that if mistakes are made in the cleaning process, the original information can be recovered."
msgstr "資料清理(Data cleaning)是修補上階段找出的錯誤的過程，其可同義於「資料清潔」(注意：有些人使用「資料清潔」一詞來同時概括資料驗證、清理兩個階段，但此處並非此用法)。這階段中，要避免無意間的資料損失、同時在更改資料時要特別小心。較好的做法是新舊並存(保留原始資料、及更正後的版本)，且並排保存在資料庫中，藉此若在清理時出錯時還能恢復成原始資料。"

"We generally understand that the data in each row of a table means something. \n"
"For example each row can represent a specimen or a taxa that was found at a particular place, at a particular time, by a particular person. \n"
"It would be odd to have one row in a table that represents a specimen followed by a row that represents a collection site. \n"
"We also often want to analyse, sort and compare values of particular attributes between rows. \n"
"For example you may want find the mean weight of all the Kenyan bats. \n"
"So ideally we want to use a system to store our data that: 1) always holds the rows together; 2)does not mix data types; 3) and segregates data in each table to a single concept or theme. \n"
"These are functions of a database!\n"
